# API Typesetting

One of the greatest things about typesetting is hinting. All API frameworks should have easily creatable and dev
downloadable type structure and documentation that works in your editor. There should also be route for servers to setup
end to end testing in the comments in order to give examples of how to use such a API. This means that DevScript will
have to work out of the box with other languages which might necessitate a separate package or framework from DevScript.

This is a high priority because it is an essential to have tools for front end frameworks to communicate. That being
said, working across multiple communication frameworks and languages is extremely difficult and dynamic so it will be
at the bottom of the list for major priorities.

There also isn't much to say about it since it is somewhat of a new venture so there will not be any decisions made on
it until there is some significantly useful part of the language.
